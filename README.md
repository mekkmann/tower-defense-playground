# tower-defense-playground
A learning project focused on creating a Tower Defense game inspired by MMORPG mechanics

While art isn't the main focus, I hope to create custom assets if time or inspiration allows

## Tower Types
### Standard Projectile Tower (V1 implemented)
#### V1
- Fires a projectile at a single target, deals damage to a singular target
### AoE Tower (V1 implemented)
#### V1
- Fires an explosive projectile at a single target, deals damage to all enemies caught in the blast radius and additional damage the enemy hit directly by the explosive projectile
#### V2
- Fires an explosive projectile at a single targets location in an arch (cannon-like), deals damage to all enemies caught in the blast radius and additional damage to any potential enemy hit directly by the explosive projectile
### Debuff Tower (Not yet implemented)
#### V1
- Applies a debuff to all enemies in range of the tower

## Enemy Types
