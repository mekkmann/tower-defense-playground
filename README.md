# tower-defense-playground
A learning project focused on creating a Tower Defense game inspired by MMORPG mechanics

While art isn't the main focus, I hope to create custom assets if time or inspiration allows

## Tower Types
### Standard Projectile Tower (V1 implemented)
- Fires a projectile at a single target, deals damage to a singular target
### AoE Tower (In progress)
- Fires an explosive projectile at a single targets location, deals damage to all enemies caught in the blast radius and additional damage to any potential enemy hit directly by the explosive projectile
### Debuff Tower (Not yet implemented)
- Applies a debuff to all enemies in range of the tower

## Enemy Types
### Basic (V1 implemented)
- Normal damage reduction and normal HP
- *[Not yet implemented]* Can increase their own movement speed and damage (Berserk)
### Tank (V1 implemented)
- Higher damage reduction and higher HP
- Can force towers in range to target it instead of other enemies for a short amount of time (Taunt)
### Healer (V1 implemented)
- Lower damage reduction and lower HP
- Heals a single enemy type in range of the healer (Heal)
